I was listening to a song called rockets while I was coding this out.

This is web implementation of instagrams story maker. This tackles static image generation using the Canvas API because honestly I just wanted an easier way to create quotes wallpapers without needing to use instagram. It is still in progress and if you see this, i expect to get it done real soon. Once done it will go live.

Goal: In the near feature you should...

- [x] Be able to change background colors
- [ ] Be able to upload images
- [x] Able to add text
- [ ] Able to change text (content, font, size)
- [ ] Able to move and scale any element
- [ ] Able to download your work
